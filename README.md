SIMAN SAYS GAME

Simon Says is a classic children's game that tests players' ability to follow instructions. One person, called "Simon," gives commands to the other players. The trick is that the players should only follow the command if it starts with the phrase "Simon says". If Simon gives a command without saying "Simon says" first, and a player still follows it, they are out of the game.

How to Play Simon Says
Choose a Leader – One person is "Simon."
Give Commands – Simon issues commands, like:
"Simon says touch your nose." (Players must touch their nose.)
"Simon says jump twice." (Players must jump twice.)
Tricky Commands – Sometimes, Simon will give a command without saying "Simon says":
"Clap your hands." (If players clap, they are out because Simon didn't say "Simon says.")
Elimination – If a player follows a command that doesn’t start with "Simon says," they are eliminated.
Last Person Standing Wins – The game continues until only one person remains.
